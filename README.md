## Cozmo - Exercise Buddy
Cozmo throws a tantrum when asked to workout, after waking up (for example, when you say "it's time for some exercise cozmo"). Then he starts exercising with the cube.
You can make him change pace by giving him commands ("Faster" or "Slower"). After it becomes too fast for him to handle, he becomes too tired and dozes off.
